			“As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush illustrates about how diverse functions that computer handles. One machine can replace differnet functions of other machines such as camera, calculator, and a typewriter. Machine enables long and complicating jobs to be done in a short time. Considering that the passage is written at 1945, it was amazing how Bush’s thoughts/prediction actually matches a lot with machines now. As I read the passage, I thought while machines have taken lots of works from human, there are parts that only machine can handle and there are parts that only scientists (human) can handle.</p>
