		<h1>What is the title of the poem?</h1>
		<h2>Hint: nonsense</h2>
    	<span class="Mirror">
			'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br>
			Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
			All mimsy were the borogoves <br>
			And the mome raths outgrabe. <br>
			<br>
			Beware the jabberwock my son <br>
			the jaws that bite the claws that catch <br>
			Beware the Jubjub birtd, and shun <br>
			The frumious Bandersnatch <br>
			<br>
			He took his vorpal sword in hand; <br>
			Long time the manxome foe he sought-- <br>
			So rested he by the Tumtum tree <br>
			And stood awhile in thought. <br>
			<br>
			And, as in uffish thought he stood, <br>
			The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,	 <br>
			Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
			And burbled as it came!<br>
			<br>
			One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
			The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
			He left it dead, and with its head<br>
			He went galumphing back.<br>
			<br>
			“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
			Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
			O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
			He chortled in his joy.<br>
			<br>
			’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
			Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
			All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
			And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
			<br>
