				Both video and the book version of “Ways of Seeing” was very interesting. All chapters (episodes) discuss about the topics that are all controversial until this day. Although the details might have changed a bit. For instance, the main reproduction of art discussed in Ways of Seeing was painting to the film. The reproduction of art is becoming more and more interesting due to diverse tools. Lots of old paintings are reproduced through gifs and even NFT. I agree to John Berger that reproduction may lose the detail of the original paintings. However, I still think the approach of the reproduction is not to capture the detail of the original but to popularize for the user. While the original is very limited to see in real life, the reproduction of the painting in film and file are extremely easy to access. Still, there are people who visit to see the original painting, which clearly shows that the goal of two differnet medium is totally different.

				Men Act while Women Appear

				Another big topic of the essay is the representation of men and women. Traditional representation of depicting women as a passive subject is widely acknowledged. The nudity of women did not have contextual meaning or value. John Berger criticizes that such seeing of women is continued until this day; "’ideal" spectator is always assumed to be male and the image of the woman is designed to flatter him."  I believe this are the parts that creators can definately work on. Throughout the history, art has been influeced greatly by the history. As many people are working greatly to improve the equality over gender, race, ethnicity and more, I believe that such works will be depicted in art as well.
				It was also interesting to feel the differenece between the video version and the book version. I think the fact that the book was actually reproduced as a video made the overall topic of the book more interesting. The video was appealing to see diverse art pieces(in color!) with John Berger’s narration. While the book went more deep into the oil painting and the tradition and history behind.
